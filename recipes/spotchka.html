    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Spotchka was a beverage that could be created from the creatures known
      as<br />
      krill. It could be found on Sorgan, brewed by the resident farmers of
      an<br />
      isolated farming village. Klatooinian raiders who often attacked the<br />
      village stole the krill from the farmers, brewing their own spotchka.
